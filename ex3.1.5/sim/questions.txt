QUESTION 4
This implementation stores a value B on 4 bits, then it gets serially the value A in a 3-bit register, and it adds the forth value A on the right. Then it sums the two values in order to get serially the output of the sum.
It uses a FSM to handle all the control signal that are given to the different registers.
